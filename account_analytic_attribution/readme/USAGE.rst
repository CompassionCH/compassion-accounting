To use this module, go to menu Invoicing/Analytic Accounting:

* Create analytic attributions: choose an analytic tag and setup the
  distribution applied for this tag. You can add conditions to filter analytic
  lines that will be distributed.
* The distribution is either performed with the CRON or you can launch it
  manually for the current fiscal year using the menu `Launch Distribution`
