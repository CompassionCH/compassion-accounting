This module is meant to be the successor of Odoo 8 Analytic Plans.
However, it works a bit differently. Instead of directly
dispatch analytic lines into several analytic accounts, you can setup rules
on how you want to perform the distribution, and distribution will be done
periodically (or can be triggered manually).
