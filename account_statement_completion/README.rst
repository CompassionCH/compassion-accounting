This module adds a way to implement methods that will enrich the bank
statement lines imported and give an easy way to add custom completion
rules with some python code directly at the interface level.

A completion rule can be attached to a journal for it to be launched
when a bank statement is imported for the journal.

It comes with three generic rules :

   1. Find a partner from the reference, if a move line exists with the
      same reference.
   2. Completion method for finding supplier invoices based the amount.
   3. From payment order, payments references.

If more than one rule are defined for a journal, rules are applied in
sequence order. The first returning results is kept.
